Whenever I was helpless, you were always there to help me, cover for me. Even after college, you ain’t gonna get rid of me. Tor barite topke porbo. You have the simplest cleanest heart which makes you so amazing. Always stay the same. BTW your whatsapp status is enough to prepare for UPSC. --- Sreyoshi.",

Gaali dena bhi seekh le tu, kyuki usme theory kaam nahi ayegi. Par ek baat hai tu IAS acha bann skta hai(par dhyaan se, tere liye salary kam pad jayegi kyuki 'shrawan kumar' koi galat kaam nahi karenge). All the best!

You had been my caring, loving friend in my life in B'Tech and it can't be expressed how much care it is. I wish that in the busy life after graduation, we stay in touch each other. You shouldn't forget about informing my Bro's details and showing a pic of him in the future. I will miss you a lot. I wish you all the best for your bright future zilla collector.

I am forced to type all this out as you have locked us in my room and would not let us leave till we finish filling the yearbook. JK JK. I have seen you grow so much these past two years. I have witnessed you winning so many battles the world does not even know of. You are one of the strongest and most passionate people I know. I will miss waking you up on holiday mornings for PE. I will miss the “LUNCH AT 12:15?” texts. My yoga partner, my philosophical walk partner. I had the best time spending that semester with you and samar as my roommates. It was the coziest and happiest time on campus for me. I couldn’t wait for the day to end so I could sit with you guys cuddled up inside that fluffy blanket and watch game of thrones. You two were nothing less of angels in these stressful two years of my life. There are so many more memories that I can’t even begin listing. Just know that I love you so much and will always be here for you forever and ever. Baki tum samjhdaar ho. Mwuahhh.",

Without you, I can't even imagine how boring it would have been!\n\nWe've shared so many good times together, from our adventures at Aibaan to the ups and downs we've faced together. But what I cherish most about our friendship is how you've been like a second mom to me, always looking out for me and being there when I needed you the most. \nAnd let's not forget our shared love for music! It's amazing how we always seem to have the same taste in songs. I want to thank you for making Gujarat feel like a good space to me.

And let's not forget your heart of gold - you always put your friends first, and your kindness and thoughtfulness never go unnoticed.\n\nBut what really sets you apart is your ability to be both a deep thinker and an articulate speaker. Whether we're discussing the meaning of life or just catching up on the latest gossip, you always bring so much insight and perspective to the table. And I can't even count how many times you've remembered the little things - like my favorite snack (coin khakra) - it just shows how much you truly care about the people around you.\n\nBut let's be real, if you weren't a HSS student, you'd definitely be a nurse - you have such a caring and nurturing personality that would make you amazing in that field. And even though we're graduating soon and going our separate ways, I know that you'll continue to be the best friend anyone could hope for, no matter where life takes us.\n\nSo here's to you, Praisy - thank you for an amazing two years together, for being a comforting presence, and for always appreciating the beauty in life. You truly are one in a million, and I'm so lucky to call you my best friend.\n\nTo many more sky gazing sessions!!\n\nLove you to the moon and back,\nShofa Ben",

And you wouldn't say why too? Well, great. Screw you, mofo.\nChapter 3: An overnight video call with not a single second of awkward pauses. What better way to start a semester woohoo! Wait, what?? We weren't talking for a year, were we? Meh. forget it. Let's keep the chitter-chatter rolling. Time for the thank you overdue. Thanks for dealing with my guards-up and guards-down oscillations, for standing by the shut door that remained shut, and yet, for breaking the ice all by yourself every single time. Definitely no thanks for cancelling up on the Goa trip, though.\nChapter 4: Oof! Honestly, kya batau? Aadhe time main soti reh gayi aur baaki time you tried waking me up and failed hahahaha. Achha, but seriously, the placements!!! My oh my. Anxiety, stress, negativity, and self-doubt ke beech, thank for always being there. Ek semester gaya in getting placed toh dusra gaya in deciding ek dusre se kaunse gifts lootenge after we start working. List bana lena mera, ek bhi gift kam nahi hona chahiye :)\n\nAll in all, zyada adventurous roller coaster kya tha? College - 0, Achal - 108!!!",
