It only took you two years, but you made it! Congrats on finally completing this monumental task. I'm sure it's been a real struggle for you.\nI mean, who knew that partying until 3 AM and skipping class would eventually catch up to you? But you did it, and that's what really matters, right? 🙂 \nAs you venture out into the \"real world,\" don't forget all the valuable lessons you have learned during your time here. Like how to sleep for a whole day or how to survive on a diet of Maggi and energy drinks.\nBut all jokes aside, you should be proud of yourself for making it this far. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to post-graduate.\nAnd I know that you’re a bit emotional person, but promise me that you will never goanna cry after certain ups and downs. Please call me at that time, I am always there for you.❤️❤️\nOnce again congrats on your post-grad and best of luck for your future."

I still remember the all night zoom meetings, Rahasya ki story, you being the middleman and that one book set we ordered that I am yet to see and ofcourse Macha kitkat. I will wait for a Rakhi gift every year and I hope it is as cool as the bucket hat. Hoping you drop your m obsession soon, get a frigging PhD and just be yourself. ",

I have so many memories of all the countless nights we have spent, the Vandan par intro meeting, countless and endless rants about *we know who* and in general for setting the bar so high. As Nakul said, \"Itna pyaar kese krte ho bhaiya\", I have no idea how you guys have the kind of love for Blith that you hold. Ab itne successful hone hi vale ho toh thode dollar apne fest ko bhi de hi dena. EM will always be my go to group for any gossips, idhar udhar ki jankari, career ka gyaan. Though I still keep bahut saara beef ki I was never a part of the Pronites team skill ke kaaran, par theeke. I hope we continue the legacy you all are leaving. Agle saal spons calls ka wait krna hi sahi. ",
